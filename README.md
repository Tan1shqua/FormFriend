# FormFriend
## HackVGEC 2023

We, the team CodeBLinders, have devoted ourselves in developing a platform that'll make a seamless collaboration for the administrators and the students. 

Our platform will be a go to place to find out the active forms that are initiated by the faculties so that they don't miss out on any deadlines.

For Faculties, it will be easy to find out which students are yet to fill the form and who all needs the follow-ups.

We have added the features of manual and automated reminders.
